# my_printf

{EPITECH} | First year | Unix System programming project

You must recode the printf function from the C library according to the C99 standard. 
Your function should be prototyped like the printf function.
You do not have to implement the C library printf buffer handling.
You must process all printf formating flags except the following (which are optional):

  - float or double types management,
  - %n flag management,
  - "*" , "’" and "I" (capital i) flags management.
  
You must add a %b formating flag, which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base.
You must also add a %S formating flag, which prints a character string (like %s). 
However, non-printable characters (ASCII value strictly smaller than 32 or greater or equal than 127) must be represented by a back slash to be followed by the character’s value in octal base.
